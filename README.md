Finding the right place to stay in Seattle might be a hustle for many people when visiting, and pricing plays a significant role in the booking process. Thus, in this analysis, which part of Udacity’s Data Science Nanodegree, I will try answering three main questions as shown below:
 
1- Can seasonality increase prices?
2- What are the main factors that affect prices?
3- Can you save money while looking for a place?

Before starting the analysis, let us understand how pricing works in Airbnb. According to their website, the final price can be broken into three types as listed below:

1-   Airbnb: "Guest service fee charged by Airbnb—this provides 24/7 community support and helps everything run to ensure the system runs smoothly."
2-   Host: Nightly rate, Cleaning fee, and Extra guest fee.
3-   Other: Currency exchange fee, VAT, and other local taxes required in certain countries/cities.
